## HARDWARE

```markdown
    
   Use:     `lsusb` 
   To:      show all usb peripherical component plugged to the device

```
You can use the directory of peripherical devices to find your usb or pci device driver, which is usually stored in: `/dev/`


```markdown
    
   Use:     `lspci` 
   To:      show all peripherical component interface plugged to the slots of the device.

```

```markdown
    
   Use:     `lshw` 
   To:      show all kind of devices connected to the pc.

```

```markdown
    
   Use:     `lsmod` 
   To:      show all modules loaded.
   Example:
             `lsmod | grep sound`
   Note: Wheter you need to do throubleshooting with some peripherical device, use this directory to search all your modules availables and determine possible problems with the controller of that device: 
                                    /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel
   
```

```markdown
    
   Use:     `modprobe` 
   To:      Load a module
   Example:
             `modprobe soundcore`
   
```

```markdown
    
   Use:     `uname` with +  `-a, -r, and others` 
   To:      Print all kind of information about the system.

```     
    
## SYSTEM
### GNU GRUB 
GRUB is a complete program for loading and managing the boot process. It is the most common bootloader for Linux distributions. A bootloader is the first software that runs when a computer starts. It loads the kernel of the operating system and then the kernel initializes the rest of the operating system: shell, display manager, desktop environment, etc.
GRUB is both a bootloader (load the OS) and a boot manager (allows you to choose between operating systems, if there is more than one on your system).


## NETWORK CONFIGURATIONS

                    LLMNR setting: no
                    MulticastDNS setting: no
                    DNSOverTLS setting: no
                    DNSSEC setting: no
                    DNSSEC supported: no

                `
                
```

### DNS

To search a ip address of a dns you can use:

```markdown
    
    Use: `host google.com`
    
    Note: this is simillar to `tracert` in windows
```

Also to search a problem with the dns you can use the `ping` command to the ip and the dns to check it.

Additionally, you can use the file or directory of the DNS configuration, which is usually stored in the directory: 
                        `cat /etc/resolv.conf`

#### Create your own DNS indices

```markdown
    
    Use: `sudo nano /etc/hosts`
    
    Here you can add your own ip/dns configuration
    
```

### SSH Connectivity 

You need install and runing a software on both the client and the server machine to enable the conection. Here I advice you the OpenSSH

```markdown
                sudo apt install openssh-server
                sudo apt install openssh-client
             
```
The ssh configuration you can find it in: `/etc/ssh`
And if you need to change the parameters you can change the file: `sudo nano ssh_config`

To connect to a ssh server you can use:
```markdown
               command: ssh pepito @ 10.0.0.1 
                            [____]   [______]
                               |         |_______ public ip address of the remote ssh system
                               |_________________ user of the remote system
```

And if you need to specify the protocol, you can use:
```markdown
               command: ssh -p 2222  pepito  @ 10.0.0.1 
                               [___] [_____]   [______]
                                 |      |          |________ public ip address of the remote ssh system
                                 |      |___________________ user of the remote system
                                 |__________________________ the specific port of the connection
```

Or if you need to run an instance of Amazon, use:
```markdown
               command: ssh -i /home/mortem/Documents/key.pem  ubuntu @ 10.0.0.1 
                               [_____________________________] [_____]  [_______]
                                              |                   |         |________ public ip address of remote instance
                                              |                   |__________________ user of the remote system          
                                              |______________________________________ This is the key generated in AWS when you create the instance, you need download it.
                                              
```

### SCP - Secure Copy

To make secure copy files between remote machines. You can use:
```markdown
                command: scp /home/mortem/Documents/pepito.text  ubuntu @ 10.0.1.12  : /home/remote_user/Documents/
                             [________________________________]  [____]   [________]   [__________________________]
                                             |                      |          |                    |________________ location or directory to place the shared file into remote user
                                             |                      |          |_____________________________________ public ip address of remote system
                                             |                      |________________________________________________ remote user 
                                             |_______________________________________________________________________ local document or file that you want to share to the remote user
                             
```


## SYSTEM NAVEGATION

### Directories
```markdown
    
    Use `.` to refer to the current directory
    
    Use `..` to refer to the above directory
  
```

### To get a specific column of a .csv
```markdown
    
            `cut -d: -f3 archivo.csv`
                  [_] [_] 
                   |   |_ _ The number of column that we need to get the value  
                   |
                    - The delimiter of the columns
  
```

### To sort information
```markdown

            You can use:

                            `sort -r`: to sort in ascendent way
                            `sort -n`: to sort according to the value of the column

```

### To count characters in a file

            `wc file.txt`
            `--wordcount file.txt`

```

## USERS AND GROUPS PERMISSIONS


## SCRIPTING

### Shell scripting
You can use any shell that you prefer, the only you need is to install that shell or be sure that it's already installed. To do this you can search all of you shells in the directory: `/etc/shells`

The most used is bash shell, so you can install right now.

### Shebang / Hashbang
This is the usually name given to the bash call in a script, by the command line:

```markdown
                    #! /bin/bash
```

### Variable declare
```markdown
                declare  -i  variable1
                         [_] [_______]
                          |      |_______ name of variable
                          |______________ type of variable, integer int his case
```

### Loops - For command
```markdown
                for  s  in  $array
                    [_]     [____]
                     |         |______ the list of iterations
                     |________________ the variable of iterations
                     
                     do [action]
                     done
                     
           For instance:
                for i in {0..10..2} -----------------------------> It will begin in 0 up to 10 with increments of 2.
                    do echo "We have been through this $i times already!"
                    done
```

### If condition
```markdown
                if test [condition]
                   [__] [_________]
                     |       |____________ you can use logical operator like: `A != B`. Notice that here you need to separate each term with a space.
                     |____________________ you can replace it with brackets to revolve the condition, like: `if [ $A != $B ]`. (You need to use a space after each term!!!) 
                     
                            then [action]
                    
                    elif 
                    
                            then [action]
                    
                    else
                
                fi
```

### Switch condition
```markdown
                    while
```

### While loop
