## HARDWARE

```markdown
    
   Use:     `lsusb` 
   To:      show all usb peripherical component plugged to the device

```
You can use the directory of peripherical devices to find your usb or pci device driver, which is usually stored in: `/dev/`


```markdown
    
   Use:     `lspci` 
   To:      show all peripherical component interface plugged to the slots of the device.

```

```markdown
    
   Use:     `lshw` 
   To:      show all kind of devices connected to the pc.

```

```markdown
    
   Use:     `lsmod` 
   To:      show all modules loaded.
   Example:
             `lsmod | grep sound`
   Note: Wheter you need to do throubleshooting with some peripherical device, use this directory to search all your modules availables and determine possible problems with the controller of that device: 
                                    /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel
   
```

```markdown
    
   Use:     `modprobe` 
   To:      Load a module
   Example:
             `modprobe soundcore`
   
```

```markdown
    
   Use:     `uname [option like: -a, -r, and others ] ` 
   To:      Print all kind of information about the system.

```   


```markdown
    
   Use:        `df -h  -t  ext4` ``

## SYSTEM

### GNU GRUB 

GRUB is a complete program for loading and managing the boot process. It is the most common bootloader for Linux distributions. A bootloader is the first software that runs when a computer starts. It loads the kernel of the operating system and then the kernel initializes the rest of the operating system: shell, display manager, desktop environment, etc.
GRUB is both a bootloader (load the OS) and a boot manager (allows you to choose between operating systems, if there is more than one on your system).

It has the directory: `/grub/`

Their configuration is stored in: 
                                    `/grub/grub.cfg` 
                                    `/etc/default/grub`
                                    `/etc/grub.d`
            
You can update grub with the command:
```markdown
                sudo update-grub
```

### Linux runlevels
                    0 system halt to shut off machine
                    1 single user (rescue) mode
                    3 multi-user mode without GUI (to server aplications, providing only terminal connections)
                    5 multi-user mode with GUI (to standar desktop machine)
                    6 reboot

To set the run level use the command:
```markdown
                    sudo telinit 0-------------> old command
                    systemctl enable multi-user.target
                    systemctl isolate rescue.target
                    
```

To see your current run level use the command:
```markdown
                    systemctl get-default
```

### Priority
To set the priority you can use the `nice` command. It run a program with modified scheduling priority. To change the priority you need to be root user or superuser, otherwise you only will can change the process with a priority between 0-20. 
The default priority value is 0.

```markdown
                Command: nice -n<PRIORITY> COMMAND
                                 [_______] [_____]

                                     |_______________ The range is from -20 to 20, being the -20 the mayor priority
                 
                 For example: `nice -n-20 ./prueba.pl`
                                
```

                `
                
```

### DNS

To search a ip address of a dns you can use:

```markdown
    
    Use: `host google.com`
    
    Note: this is simillar to `tracert` in windows
```

Also to search a problem with the dns you can use the `ping` command to the ip and the dns to check it.

Additionally, you can use the file or directory of the DNS configuration, which is usually stored in the directory: 
                        `cat /etc/resolv.conf`

#### Create your own DNS indices

```markdown
    
    Use: `sudo nano /etc/hosts`
    
    Here you can add your own ip/dns configuration
    
```

### SSH Connectivity 

You need install and runing a software on both the client and the server machine to enable the conection. Here I advice you the OpenSSH

```markdown
                sudo apt install openssh-server
                sudo apt install openssh-client
             
```
The ssh configuration you can find it in: `/etc/ssh`
And if you need to change the parameters you can change the file: `sudo nano ssh_config`

To connect to a ssh server you can use:
```markdown
               command: ssh pepito @ 10.0.0.1 
                            [____]   [______]
                               |         |_______ public ip address of the remote ssh system
                               |_________________ user of the remote system
```

And if you need to specify the protocol, you can use:
```markdown
               command: ssh -p 2222  pepito  @ 10.0.0.1 
                               [___] [_____]   [______]
                                 |      |          |________ public ip address of the remote ssh system
                                 |      |___________________ user of the remote system
                                 |__________________________ the specific port of the connection
```

Or if you need to run an instance of Amazon, use:
```markdown
               command: ssh -i /home/mortem/Documents/key.pem  ubuntu @ 10.0.0.1 
                               [_____________________________] [_____]  [_______]
                                              |                   |         |________ public ip address of remote instance
                                              |                   |__________________ user of the remote system          
                                              |______________________________________ This is the key generated in AWS when you create the instance, you need download it.
                                              
```

### SCP - Secure Copy

To make secure copy files between remote machines. You can use:
```markdown
                command: scp /home/mortem/Documents/pepito.text  ubuntu @ 10.0.1.12  : /home/remote_user/Documents/
                             [________________________________]  [____]   [________]   [__________________________]
                                             |                      |          |                    |________________ location or directory to place the shared file into remote user
                                             |                      |          |_____________________________________ public ip address of remote system
                                             |                      |________________________________________________ remote user 
                                             |_______________________________________________________________________ local document or file that you want to share to the remote user
                             
```


## SYSTEM NAVEGATION

### Directories
```markdown
    
    Use `.` to refer to the current directory
    
    Use `..` to refer to the above directory
  
```

### To get a specific column of a .csv
```markdown
    
            `cut -d: -f3 archivo.csv`
                  [_] [_] 
                   |   |____ The number of column that we need to get the value  
                   |________ The delimiter of the columns
  
```

### To sort information
```markdown

            You can use:
                            `sort`: to sort in descendent way
                            `sort -r`: to sort in ascendent way
                            `sort -n`: to sort according to the value of the column

```

### To count characters in a file
```markdown

            `wc file.txt`
            `--wordcount file.txt`

```

## USERS AND GROUPS PERMISSIONS

### Types of object owners
There are: - User (owner)
           - Group
           - Other

### User lists
There are two ways to see the user list, the firt is through the directory: `etc/passwd`


### User passwords



## SCRIPTING

### Shell scripting
You can use any shell that you prefer, the only you need is to install that shell or be sure that it's already installed. To do this you can search all of you shells in the directory: `/etc/shells`

The most used is bash shell, so you can install right now.

### Shebang / Hashbang
This is the usually name given to the bash call in a script, by the command line:

```markdown
                    #! /bin/bash
```

### Variable declare
```markdown
                declare  -i  variable1
                         [_] [_______]
                          |      |_______ name of variable
                          |______________ type of variable, integer int his case
```

### Export a variable
```makdown
                export variablename
```

### Loops - For command
```markdown
                for  s  in  $array
                    [_]     [____]
                     |         |______ the list of iterations
                     |________________ the variable of iterations
                     
                     do [action]
                     done
                     
           For instance:
                for i in {0..10..2} -----------------------------> It will begin in 0 up to 10 with increments of 2.
                    do echo "We have been through this $i times already!"
                    done
```

### If condition
