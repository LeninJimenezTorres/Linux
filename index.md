## HARDWARE

```markdown
    
   Use:     `lsusb` 
   To:      show all usb peripherical component plugged to the device

```
You can use the directory of peripherical devices to find your usb or pci device driver, which is usually stored in: `/dev/`


```markdown
    
   Use:     `lspci` 
   To:      show all peripherical component interface plugged to the slots of the device.

```

```markdown
    
   Use:     `lshw` 
   To:      show all kind of devices connected to the pc.

```

```markdown
    
   Use:     `lsmod` 
   To:      show all modules loaded.
   Example:
             `lsmod | grep sound`
   Note: Wheter you need to do throubleshooting with some peripherical device, use this directory to search all your modules availables and determine possible problems with the controller of that device: 
                                    /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel
   
```

```markdown
    
   Use:     `modprobe` 
   To:      Load a module
   Example:
             `modprobe soundcore`
   
```

```markdown
    
   Use:     `uname [option like: -a, -r, and others ] ` 
   To:      Print all kind of information about the system.

```   


```markdown
    
   Use:        `df -h  -t  ext4` ``
                   [_] [_] [___]
                    |   |    |_____ formating type

                    |______________ Human readable size units
                
   To:      Display all the block devices current mounted on the system
   
```

    
## SYSTEM

### GNU GRUB 

GRUB is a complete program for loading and managing the boot process. It is the most common bootloader for Linux distributions. A bootloader is the first software that runs when a computer starts. It loads the kernel of the operating system and then the kernel initializes the rest of the operating system: shell, display manager, desktop environment, etc.
GRUB is both a bootloader (load the OS) and a boot manager (allows you to choose between operating systems, if there is more than one on your system).

It has the directory: `/grub/`

Their configuration is stored in: 
                                    `/grub/grub.cfg` 
                                    `/etc/default/grub`
                                    `/etc/grub.d`
            
You can update grub with the command:
```markdown
                sudo update-grub
```

### Linux runlevels
                    0 system halt to shut off machine
                    1 single user (rescue) mode
                    3 multi-user mode without GUI (to server aplications, providing only terminal connections)
                    5 multi-user mode with GUI (to standar desktop machine)
                    6 reboot

To set the run level use the command:
```markdown
                    sudo telinit 0-------------> old command
                    systemctl enable multi-user.target
                    systemctl isolate rescue.target
                    
```

To see your current run level use the command:
```markdown
                    systemctl get-default
```

### Root-level directories

```
### Priority
To set the priority you can use the `nice` command. It run a program with modified scheduling priority. To change the priority you need to be root user or superuser, otherwise you only will can change the process with a priority between 0-20. 
The default priority value is 0.

```markdown
                Command: nice -n<PRIORITY> COMMAND
                                 [_______] [_____]
                                     |        |______ You can use any command like a process, script, and more.
                                     |_______________ The range is from -20 to 20, being the -20 the mayor priority
                 
                 For example: `nice -n-20 ./prueba.pl`
                                
```


## NETWORK CONFIGURATIONS

                `
                
```

### DNS

To search a ip address of a dns you can use:

```markdown
    
    Use: `host google.com`
    
    Note: this is simillar to `tracert` in windows
```

Also to search a problem with the dns you can use the `ping` command to the ip and the dns to check it.

Additionally, you can use the file or directory of the DNS configuration, which is usually stored in the directory: 
                        `cat /etc/resolv.conf`

#### Create your own DNS indices

```markdown
    
    Use: `sudo nano /etc/hosts`
    
    Here you can add your own ip/dns configuration
    
```

### SSH CONNECTIVITY 

#### Install OpenSSH
You need install and runing a software on both the client and the server machine to enable the conection. Here I advice you the OpenSSH

```markdown
                sudo apt install openssh-server
                sudo apt install openssh-client
             
```
The ssh configuration you can find it in: `/etc/ssh`
And if you need to change the parameters you can change the file: `sudo nano ssh_config`

#### Testing SSH service
You can check this through the running web services listening to connection, with the commnd:
```markdown
                Command: sudo netstat -t  -u  -l  -p  -n
                                      [_] [_] [_] [_] [_]

                                       |   |   |____________ Listening process
                                       |   |________________ UDP running ports

                Description: Here you can see all web services running in your system, for instance:

                                    udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:631             0.0.0.0:*                           668/cups-browsed    
                                    udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:47957           0.0.0.0:*                           533/avahi-daemon: r 
                                    udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5353            0.0.0.0:*                           533/avahi-daemon: r 
                                    udp6       0      0 :::41427                :::*                                533/avahi-daemon: r 
                                    udp6       0      0 :::5353                 :::*                                533/avahi-daemon: r 
                            
                            In this example, you can see the TCP - 22 port service/protocol running through the directory `sshd:/user/sbin`
                                
```

Also you can check the directory sshd:
```markdown
                Command: which sshd
                Description: here you will see the directory where the ssh service was installed, for instance: `/user/sbin/sshd`
```

Also you can check if the SSH is running with:
```makdown
                Command: systemctl status ssh
                Description: Here you will get the status of the SSH service, like the follow:

#### Remote connection thorugh SSH
To connect to a ssh server you can use:
```markdown
               command: ssh pepito @ 10.0.0.1 
                            [____]   [______]
                               |         |_______ public ip address of the remote ssh system
                               |_________________ user of the remote system
```
First off you need to choose the `Bridge adapter` inside `Network configuration` if you are connecting to a virtual machine like VirtualBox 

And if you need to specify the protocol, you can use:
```markdown
               command: ssh -p 2222  pepito  @ 10.0.0.1 
                               [___] [_____]   [______]
                                 |      |          |________ public ip address of the remote ssh system
                                 |      |___________________ user of the remote system
                                 |__________________________ the specific port of the connection
```

Or if you need to run an instance of Amazon, use:
```markdown
               command: ssh -i /home/mortem/Documents/key.pem  ubuntu @ 10.0.0.1
